## About
This repo represents a learning document as I further my skills in javascript, html, and css. Since I am a graduation of the Turing School of Software and Design (my main resource for learning), there may be sections that are addressed but not necessarily fully followed (which I will notate when that happens)

## Resources
- Started with the Turing School of Software and Design's [Mod 0 Foundation](https://mod0.turing.io)
- Following the Turing's [Mod 1 Front End Curriculum](https://frontend.turing.io)
- Using exercism's [Javascript track](https://exercism.io/my/tracks/javascript) for daily practice
