## Part 4 - Vue CLI and To Do App
- **Environment:** I have a MacOS and my IDE is Atom. I am using the native Terminal on Mac.
- [Intro to Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
- Vue is a progressive framework that helps you build user interfaces; the library focuses on the view layer (hence the name Vue!)
- Great for Single-Page Appllications (SPAs) OR integrating with other libraries/projects
- [Vue Hello World Example](https://codepen.io/team/Vue/pen/KKpRVpx)
- [To Do App Tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-a-to-do-app-with-vue-js-2)
- Prerequisites:
  - [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com)
    - To [install](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)
  - [Vue Command Line Interface](https://cli.vuejs.org)
    - To [install](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)
  - **What I did:**, I already have `npm`, so I simply used `npm install -g @vue/cli`
  - **Terminal Output:**
    ```console
    /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/frontend  $üêßnpm install -g @vue/cli

    Thank you for installing EJS: built with the Jake JavaScript build tool (https://jakejs.com/)

    npm WARN @vue/compiler-sfc@3.0.5 requires a peer of vue@3.0.5 but none is installed. You must install peer dependencies yourself.

    + @vue/cli@4.5.11
    added 1407 packages from 714 contributors in 48.52s
    ```
  - **Confirm:** using `vue --version` I see `@vue/cli 4.5.11`
- The "out the box" packages that come with `Vue CLI` are:
  ```console
  webpack - A full-featured Webpack + Vue-loader setup with hot reload, linting, testing & CSS extraction.
  webpack-simple - A simple Webpack + Vue-loader setup for quick prototyping.
  browserify - A full-featured Browserify + vueify setup with hot-reload, linting & unit testing.
  browserify-simple - A simple Browserify + vueify setup for quick prototyping.
  simple - The simplest possible Vue setup in a single HTML file
  ```
 - **SO LET US GET STARTED!!**
- You can work with online IDE's like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) or [Repl](https://repl.it), **however**, I enjoy working locally using my own IDE (in this case I am working with Atom (currently MacOS only), but there are plenty of great IDE's out there like VSCode and such)
- _Create a new project:_ First, I nagivated to the project pathway I desire my new project to be in (in my case: `/Users/<name>/Coding/learning_projects`). Then, in the terminal I use `vue init webpack todo-app` where `todo-app` is the name of my application/project
  - **UH OH** - I ran into an error
    ```console
    /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/frontend  $üêßvue init webpack todo-app

    Command vue init requires a global addon to be installed.
    Please run npm i -g @vue/cli-init and try again.
    ```
- To fix this I ran `npm i -g @vue/cli-init`
  ```console
    /Users/priyapower/Coding/learning/frontend  $üêßnpm i -g @vue/cli-init
    npm WARN deprecated vue-cli@2.9.6: This package has been deprecated in favour of @vue/cli

    + @vue/cli-init@4.5.11
    added 251 packages from 206 contributors in 13.635s
  ```
-  Tried this command again: `vue init webpack todo-app` and I now see the prompts I expect
-  As each question is prompted, what is in the parenthesis represents what will default if you hit `enter`, otherwise begin typing to override and hit `enter` for the next prompt
  ```console
  ? Project name todo-app
  ? Project description An introductory Vue.js project
  ? Author Priya Power <49959312+priyapower@users.noreply.github.com>
  ? Vue build standalone
  ? Install vue-router? No
  ? Use ESLint to lint your code? Yes
  ? Pick an ESLint preset Standard
  ? Set up unit tests Yes
  ? Pick a test runner jest
  ? Setup e2e tests with Nightwatch? Yes
  ? Should we run `npm install` for you after the project has been created? (recommended) npm
  ````
- Once prompts were completed:
  ```console
     vue-cli ¬∑ Generated "todo-app".

-  Following the "To get started" info, I can use `cd todo-app` followed by `npm run dev` (which will run development)
  - In the tutorial it asks us to run `npm install` (which installs dependencies), but in my prompts I selected the option to have it autorun this for me already, which is why I was able to skip this step
  - The output for `npm run dev`
